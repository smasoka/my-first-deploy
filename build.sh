# Be careful of capitalisation and semantic versioning differences
# E.g. ApplicationName-v.1.2.3 is different from application-name-1.2.3 and so on.

# The build nodes have 8 core jobs. jobs are blocking, which means you can build with at least 8 core parallelism.
# this might cause instability in the builds, so it's up to you.
